## Introduction

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to harm or exploit computer systems and networks. It encompasses a wide range of threats, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and more. Malware can cause severe damage to computers and compromise sensitive data.

The goal of this project is to provide a repository of malware samples along with analysis reports, enabling researchers, analysts, and enthusiasts to learn about various malware types, their behavior, and potential mitigation techniques.

## Malware Samples

The `malware_samples` directory contains a collection of executable (`.exe`) files. Each file represents a different malware sample and is labeled accordingly. These samples have been gathered from various sources and are intended for educational and research purposes only. **Please exercise caution when handling these files and ensure you are in a controlled and isolated environment.**

## Analysis Reports

The `analysis_reports` directory contains detailed reports for each malware sample. These reports document the analysis process, including static and dynamic analysis techniques employed, observed behavior, potential impact, and suggested mitigation strategies.

The reports aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the malware samples, their capabilities, and potential countermeasures to protect computer systems against similar threats.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have additional malware samples to share or analysis reports to contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add the malware sample to the `malware_samples` directory.
3. Create a detailed analysis report in the `analysis_reports` directory, following the existing report template.
4. Make sure to include relevant information such as the malware's behavior, observed indicators, and potential countermeasures.
5. Submit a pull request, explaining the changes made.
